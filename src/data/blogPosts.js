      Speaking is a skill you build by doing. Start by talking to yourself in English for 5 minutes daily. Practice shadowing short audio clips, record and listen back, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Gradually increase the length of conversations and seek feedback from tutors or language partners.

      Other tactics include learning set phrases for common situations, focusing on pronunciation of problem sounds, and using role-play to rehearse real-life interactions.

      Consistency wins. Commit to short daily practices: 10 minutes of vocabulary, 10 minutes of listening, and 10 minutes of speaking. Use spaced repetition for vocabulary and a simple journal to write two sentences each day.

      Over weeks, these small habits compound into meaningful improvement.
